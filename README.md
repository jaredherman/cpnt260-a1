Technical issues I had: creating the code on vscode I had technical issues when I was trying to include some css into the html and just ended up going onto freecodecamp and copied their css coding to the assignment. I tried adding a border to the image but it was unsuccessful so I just let it as it is because I am satisfied with the way it is.
Attributions: for the css I copied all the code from freecodecamp
