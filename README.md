Technical issues I had: creating the code on vscode I had technical issues when I was trying to include some css into the html and just ended up doing minimal css to the assignment
Attributions: for the css I coded I was inspired and used code from the freecodecamp website for the heading color but I did not use the code for the heading font-family.
